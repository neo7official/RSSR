				        <p>A ‘skills matrix’ falls within the ‘skills management’ process.  A skills matrix is a grid or table that clearly and visibly illustrates the skills and competence held by individuals within a team.  Its primary aim is to help in the understanding, development, deployment and tracking of people and their skills. Well-implemented skills matrices should identify the skills that a job role requires, the skills of all individual employees, and any gap between the two.</p>
